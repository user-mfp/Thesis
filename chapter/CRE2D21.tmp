\paragraph{Old version}

Museums, much like libraries, are foremost seen as a place of knowledge and its preservation. Hence, visitors behave in a very reserved manner. Whereas this may apply for a library, museums are willing to involve people instead of merely providing information. Many Museums therfore employ guides, who give tours and tell visitors about the exhibits. In addition to their factual knowledge, they can also provide anecdotes and other information needed to bond with a certain topic. Apart of instructive and teaching staff, museums have tried many other ways to involve their visitors more. One of those is employing technology. With time technology evolved, and so did technological augmentations in museums.

It may have started with simple mechanics, which moved some models, and later included basic electronics, which illuminated particular exhibits. Microchips and computers became more and more popular and affordable. So, the next step was immanent. There were info-terminals (...) Yet another chapter was opened, when the internet and wireless communication were introduced. Burgard et al. build an autonomous tour-guide robot called RHINO. It was able to navigate through the museum freely without bumping into visitors. RHINO could be used as a tour-guide for present visitors as well as for visitors on the internet, for it had a simple build-in and a web interface [Bur98]. RHINO was deployed at the “Deutsches Museum Bonn” in 1998.

In 2002, a group from the University of Limmerick made a survey in the Hunt Museum. The
museum is owned and run by the Hunt family, whose tradition it was from the beginning to involve the visitors. Therefore, they had so-called cabinets of curiosity [Cio02], special compartments within the exhibition, where additional exhibits were hidden. For example, one had to open drawers in order to find a collection of plates. Via this exploration, the visitors became involved. Inspired by their observations, Ciolfi et al. implemented a completely new and interactive part of the exhibition in 2005. Two new rooms were  introduced. First, there was a study room with three interactive devices for getting further information about certain exhibits. They were disguised as a chest, a painting and a desk. The second room, the room of opinion, was plain white with plinths, on which visitors could record their interpretations of intended function of certain exhibits. In  order to manage all the data, a third and hidden room was used to host all the data-servers [Cio05].
