\chapter{Background and Motivation}
\label{motivation}

Over time public places became more and more enriched with all kinds of technology. Nowadays, on nearly every corner something is beeping or blinking and buttons, leavers and knobs make us - their potential users - interact with our environment. This trend does not spare anyone or anything. Even traditionally calm and sophisticated places open up to the possibilities of contemporary technologies.

\section{Museums}
\label{motivation_museums}

Museums, much like libraries, are foremost seen as a place of knowledge and its preservation. Hence, visitors behave in a very reserved manner. Whilst applying for libraries, museums are willing to involve people instead of merely providing information. Many Museums therefor employ guides, who give tours and tell visitors about the exhibits. In addition to their factual knowledge, they also provide interesting anecdotes and other exciting information needed to bond with a certain topic. Apart of instructive and teaching staff, museums have tried many other ways to involve their visitors. One of those is employing technology. With time technology evolved, and so did technological augmentations in museums.
\\
The name ''museum'' comes from the ancient greek's ''Museion''. It describes an, in honor of a muse, sanctified place~\cite{DeutscherMuseumsbundGeschichte}. Basically, museums are collections of arts and science or at least parts of them on display. In modern history, those collections were of an artistic nature and mostly private. Later, scientific and otherwise cultural museums were established for the general public. 
\\
One of the first high-tech installation of the modern age was the \textit{Diorama}. In 1821, Louis Jacque MandÃ© Daguerre\footnote{Daguerre is a scene painter and stage designer by trade. He also is the inventor of the first photographic process called daguerreotypy} and the painter Charles Marie Bouton partnered up to develop this spectacle. It is an elaborate combination of painting and lighting~\cite{DioramaDaguerre}. Through ingenious lighting, the paintings became vivid. This way, a diorama could simulate the moods of a whole day within minutes. Thus, it might be seen as an early predecessor of the cinema. Even today, although in much smaller size, dioramas are still thematised~\cite{DioramaSchneider}.
\\
The first interactive displays appeared at the \textit{Urania} in Berlin around 1889, when they introduces visitor-activated models and a scientific theater. In 1907 the \textit{Deutsches Museum} in Munich also began experimenting with film and mechanical models, which were operated by visitors~\cite{MuseumsHistoryMcLean}. Later, other museums all over the world followed. Since then the ''[...] \textit{wider museological community's understanding of nature and purpose of interactiveness''} has taken shape. \textit{''This understanding almost invariably involves:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The presence of some technological medium.
	\item A physical exhibit which is added to the main display.
	\item A device which the visitor can operate, involving physical activity.''\textnormal{~\cite{MuseumsHistoryWitcomb}}
\end{enumerate}}

As electronics and microchips evolved, computers became popular and affordable. The technological equipment of museums grew with what was available and new kinds of devices and installations appeared. Today, nearly every museum has a certain guide system such as an audio guide. It either leads visitors through the museum on a predefined course or a visitor can choose the track according to a given code for each included exhibit. In 2004, Chou et al.  compared different museum guide systems in various categories, which were considered necessary to provide a user-friendly and informative experience. Expositors, tape machines, CD-players and a PDA were judged. The PDA was most versatile and easy to use system~\cite{MuseumGuideSystems} (\textit{Figure 1.}). The described system had the portability of an audio guide, but due to position recognition the PDA would always present the current exhibit. The system could replace common audio guides and immobile information terminals all together. In addition, it still was able to give predefined tours depending on the user's interests.
\\
Yet another chapter was opened, when the internet and wireless communication were introduced. Burgard et al. build an autonomous tour-guide robot and  called it \textit{RHINO} [Bur98]. It was able to navigate through the museum freely and without bumping into visitors. It could be used as a tour-guide for present visitors as well as for visitors on the internet, because it had a simple build-in web interface. RHINO was deployed at the \textit{Deutsches Museum Bonn} in 1998.
\\
In 2002, a group from the \textit{University of Limmerick} made a survey in \textit{Hunt Museum}. The museum is owned and run by the Hunt-family. Its tradition is to involve the visitors since its early days. Therefor, they had so-called \textit{cabinets of curiosity} [Cio02], special compartments within the exhibition, where additional exhibits were hidden. For example, a curious visitor had to open drawers in order to find a collection of plates. Via this exploration, the visitors became involved. Inspired by their observations, Ciolfi et al. implemented a completely new and interactive part of the exhibition in 2005 [Cio05]. Two new rooms were introduced. First, there was the \textit{study room} with three interactive devices for getting further information about certain exhibits. They were disguised as a chest, a painting and a desk. The second room, the \textit{room of opinion}, was plain white with plinths, on which visitors could record their interpretations of the intended function of certain exhibits. In  order to manage all the data, a third and hidden room was used to host all the data-servers.
\\
The \textit{medien.welten}-exhibition at \textit{Technisches Museum Wien} was not only showcasing technical devices from all eras and genres of modern media, it also invited visitors to make use of some. As Hornecker et al. described, throughout the exhibition users were given opportunities to produce their own medial content. The interfaces ranged from an abacus over a telegraph to a whole rebuild of a news-studio from an Austrian TV-channel. Visitors could not only use the devices, but store some of their produced contents in a \textit{digital backpack} [Hor06]. This way, visitors did not only have an exciting experience, but also something to remember it by later.
