The hardware consists of and PC, the sensor, a screen and peripheral input devices for maintenance. The designated PC is an \textit{ASUS VIVO VC60-B013M}. It employs a \textit{Intel Core i5 3210M} with a clock speed of 2x2,5GHz and 4GB DDR3 SDRAM~\cite{VivoPCVC60}. Since the system does not have complex graphics, there was no need for a sophisticated graphics card. Hence, the PC is compact and does not need much electricity. 
\\
As a display, we chose an \textit{ASUS MB168B+} with a size of 15.6'' and es resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. The display further houses its own graphics chip, which enables it to be connected to a PC via a USB3.0-cable~\cite{MB168B}. This configuration eased the installation, because of the smaller plug the holes drilled into the back wall of the showcase could be smaller than for a usual display-cable. The display is supported by a modified bookend, which is attached to the back wall with two screws. An additional hole has been drilled for the cable. This hole is hidden by the display. Although it was planned to camouflage the display with a foil, it did not seem necessary, because lighting at the new position of the display is already dim.

The soft- and firmware used for developing and running the system is based on \textit{\ac{MS} Windows 7 Professional x86}. As mentioned earlier, the software was included into \ac{FUBI}. This framework is available as an \textit{\ac{MS} Visual Studio 2010}-project. The all software is written in \text{$C\#$} and hence makes use of the \textit{\ac{MS} .NET Framework 4.5.1}~\cite{MSNET} and further \textit{\ac{MS} XNA Framework 4.0}~\cite{MSXNA} for certain functions throughout certain regions of the software. Moreover, \ac{FUBI} utilizes the functionalities of \textit{OpenNI 2.2.0.33}~\cite{OpenNI} and \textit{NiTE 2.2.0.11}~\cite{NiTE}.

Maintenance is reduced by automatic booting and shutdown. The system's BIOS boots the PC at 8:30 in the morning. A tool shuts the system down at 4:45 in the afternoon. Hence, no member of the staff has to access the PC to start or shut the system down.

\section{Libraries}
\label{implementation_libraries}

\ac{IMI} includes a collection of libraries, which can be used to implement interactive applications. At the time the functionality is restricted to free-hand pointing gestures. Other mechanisms can be easily added. An \ac{IMI}-exhibition is modularly build by those libraries. The Exhibition- and Exhibit-class have structural functionality and manage an exhibition's data. Meanwhile, the Handler-classes use this data to generate and operate the interaction between user and system.

\paragraph{Preliminaries} Terms used hereafter are depicted by Figure \ref{implementation_terms} and defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A point or corner is a point in \ac{3D} space of type \texttt{Point3D}.
	\item A plane is defined by three points or corners. 
	\item A position is a point on a plane of type \texttt{Point3D}.
	\item A pointing position is the position a user is pointing at.
	\item A pointing location it the location a pointing user is standing at.
	\item A kernel is an exhibit's membership function. It has a size and radius.
	\item A target is an exhibit's representation on the exhibition plane. It is determined by its position and kernel.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Exhibition.cs} Members of the Exhibition-class are needed to define an \ac{IMI}-exhibition. All necessary information is contained and managed in this class.

The \texttt{exhibitionPlane} is the most essential component of an \ac{IMI}-exhibition. All exhibits' positions are defined on this fundamental property. It is constructed by three corners. The structure of such a Plane is declared by the GeometryHandler-class. The Exhibition-class further holds a list of \texttt{Exhibit}-objects. In this \texttt{List} all selectable \ac{IMI}-exhibits of an \ac{IMI}-exhibition are stored. In addition, the earlier mentioned user position that defines the interaction space is also saved in this class as a point. An \ac{IMI}-exhibition's name and file path are members of the Exhibition-class, too. So are the images, which are used to camouflage the display against the background and the overview of the exhibition plane with sketches of exhibits in their respective positions. Furthermore, data crucial for interaction are also members of this class. So are the default values for the threshold needed for defining exhibits and the dwell time for target selection. Timespans used by the presentation software are \texttt{lockTime}, which determines a short period of paused interaction after selecting a target and \texttt{slideTime} which determines for how long a single image is shown during an \ac{IMI}-exhibit's presentation.

The characteristic functionality of the Exhibition-class is its get- and set-methods. They allow for reading and writing all those essential variables.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Exhibit.cs} The virtual representation of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit is structured by the Exhibit-class. This includes data relevant for interaction with the system and an \ac{IMI}-exhibit's presentation upon selection. Like an Exhibition-object, an Exhibit-object stores its own file path as well. This is necessary for organizational reasons. 

The most important member of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit is its position. In combination with the two kernel-defining members \texttt{kernelSize} and \texttt{kernelRadius} the SessionHandler-class is able to compute which target a user is pointing at.  

Members relevant for the presentation of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit are its name, descriptive text and collection of images. The images are stored in a \texttt{Dictionary} as a pair of an image's file path and the image itself. 

The Exhibit-class, just like the Exhibition-class, is of structural nature and therefore only has the same administrative methods that get and set members.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{FileHandler.cs} The objective of the FileHandler-class is \textit{saving} and \textit{loading} data of an \ac{IMI}-exhibition, its exhibits, and all their properties. Therefore, a temporary Exhibition- and Exhibit-object are needed. Exhibitions along with all related information are saved in \textit{XML-format}. The hierarchical structure of XML-files allows adding, changing and removing elements without much effort. 

To save an \ac{IMI}-exhibition and all its properties several XML-files have to be written. The main file contains the aforementioned defining properties of the exhibition. This means that each \ac{IMI}-exhibit is stored separately. It is saved as an XML-file as well. Each \ac{IMI}-file contains all properties as attributes or \textit{forwarding file paths}. Equally, corresponding images are saved as file paths leading to the actual image. The exhibition plane is also separately saved as an XML-file. 
\\
Loading works in reverse to this procedure. As en \ac{IMI}-exhibition is being loaded, its properties are either saved into a \textit{temporary Exhibition-instance} or forwarding file paths are followed. A \textit{Temporary Exhibit-instance} is used to load all of an \ac{IMI}-exhibits.
\\
The modular composition allows the \ac{IMI}-system to be flexible. \ac{IMI}-exhibits exist as independent entities and can be easily removed from or added to an existing \ac{IMI}-exhibition. The same applies for the exhibition plane. Figure \ref{fig:filehandler_data_structure} depicts the whole data-structure behind an \ac{IMI}-exhibition.

%\end{figure}

An additional function of the FileHandler-class is reading TXT-files. This feature is used to load pre-written descriptions of \ac{IMI}-exhibits.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{GeometryHandler.cs} The GeometryHandler-class is solving essential computations of analytic geometry-problems. Therefore, the two structs \texttt{Vector} and \texttt{Plane} are declared, because standard types of C$\#$ do not deliver the complexity needed for those computations.
\\
A \texttt{Vector}, in contrast to a standard \texttt{Vector3D} or \texttt{Vector3}, is not only a \textit{direction vector}. It also has a \textit{starting} and a \textit{terminal point}. Hence, a \texttt{Vector} $V$ is defined by a starting point $P_{S}$ and either an endpoint $P_{E}$ or a direction vector leading towards it $\overrightarrow{d_{E}}$, where $P_{S}$ is either a user's tracked head- or elbow-joint and $P_{E}$ is its tracked hand-joint. 
\begin{align*}
	V &= P_{S} + \lambda \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{E}} \\
	P_{V} &= P_{S} + \lambda_{P} \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{E}}
\end{align*}
As the factor $\lambda$ is varied, any point $P_{V}$ along a \texttt{Vector}'s direction of propagation can be expressed. 
\\
A \texttt{Plane} is defined by one starting corner $C_{1}$ and either two additional corners $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ or two additional \texttt{Vector}s $\overrightarrow{d_{C_{2}}}$ and $\overrightarrow{d_{C_{3}}}$ towards those corners. In short, a \texttt{Plane} $E$ is defined by two \texttt{Vector}s $V_{C_{2}}$ and $V_{C_{3}}$ of identical origin.  
\begin{align*}
	E = V_{C_{2}} + V_{C_{3}} \quad \to \quad E &= C_{1} + \lambda \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{C_{2}}} + \mu \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{C_{3}}} \\
	P_{E} &= C_{1} + \lambda_{P} \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{C_{2}}} + \mu_{P} \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{C_{3}}}
\end{align*}
Any position $P_{E}$ on a \texttt{Plain} can be expressed by varying $\lambda_{C_{2}}$ and $\mu_{C_{3}}$.

The GeometryHandler-class has two types on members. First, \textit{input-members} are pointing- and aiming points or positions. Second, \textit{output-members} are lists of classified and weighted points or positions.

However, the main task of this class is to calculate \textit{pedal points} between \texttt{Vector}s and \textit{intersections} of a \texttt{Vector} with a \texttt{Plane}. 
\\
A pedal points is calculated to define a point. Therefore, a subject has to point at this point in \ac{3D} space from two different locations. Vectors  from both locations should meet in the point to define. Intersections in \ac{3D} space are very unlikely, though. Hence, a substitute point has to be found. The closest two skew vectors come to each other is in the pedal point. Thus, this point is computed instead of an intersection. Given two \texttt{Vector}s $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ with starting points $S_{A}$ and $S_{B}$ and their respective directions $\overrightarrow{d_{A}}$ and $\overrightarrow{d_{B}}$.
$$V_{A} = S_{A} + \lambda_{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{A}} \quad and \quad V_{B} = S_{B} + \lambda_{B} \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{B}}$$
A normal is a vector, which is perpendicular to its original vector. To get the shortest distance between two \texttt{Vector}s, their normals $\overrightarrow{n_{A}}$ and $\overrightarrow{n_{B}}$ have to be perpendicular to both \texttt{Vector}s. 
$$\overrightarrow{n_{A}} = \overrightarrow{d_{A}} \times (\overrightarrow{d_{A}} \times \overrightarrow{d_{B}}) \quad and \quad \overrightarrow{n_{B}} = \overrightarrow{d_{B}} \times (\overrightarrow{d_{A}} \times \overrightarrow{d_{B}})$$
To compute the pedal point, and stay in the metaphor, the two foot points $F_{A}$ and $F_{B}$ are needed. These points lie on either \texttt{Vector} and in between them lies the pedal point. Hence, the factors $\lambda_{F_{A}}$ and $\lambda_{F_{B}}$ have to be altered.
\begin{align*}
	F_{A} &= S_{A} + \lambda_{F_{A}} \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{A}} \quad &and \quad F_{B} &= S_{B} + \lambda_{F_{B}} \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{B}} \\
	F_{A} &= S_{A} + \frac{(S_{B} - S_{A}) \bullet \overrightarrow{n_{B}}}{\overrightarrow{d_{A}} \bullet \overrightarrow{n_{B}}} \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{A}} \quad &and \quad F_{B} &= S_{B} + \frac{(S_{A} - S_{B}) \bullet \overrightarrow{n_{A}}}{\overrightarrow{d_{B}} \bullet \overrightarrow{n_{A}}} \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{B}} 
\end{align*}
The only step left is to calculate the pedal point $P_{AB}$ between the two foot points~\cite{PedalPoint} $F_{A}$ and $F_{B}$. Since the feet already represent the points on each \texttt{Vector} that are closest to the other \texttt{Vector} and $P_{AB}$ is in the middle, $P_{AB}$ is the average of them.
$$P_{AB} = (F_{A} \cdot F_{B}) / 2$$
An exemplary configuration of the problem is depicted by Figure \ref{fig:pedal_point}.

\textbf{F I G U R E}
%\begin{figure}%
%\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{filename}%
%\caption{.}%
%\label{fig:pedal_point} 
%\end{figure}

The \ac{IMI}-system's interaction is based in the principle of intersections of a \texttt{Vector} and a \texttt{Plain}. Positions of \ac{IMI}-exhibits are defined this way. Furthermore, a user's pointing and aiming position is calculated exactly the same. Thus, this computation is crucial for interaction. Given a \texttt{Vector} $V$ and a \texttt{Plane} $E$ are not parallel, they intersect in a position $P_{I}$, where $P_{I} \in V \wedge E$.   
\begin{align*}
	V = P_{S} + \lambda \cdot \overrightarrow{d} \quad &\to \quad P_{I} = P_{S} + \lambda_{I} \cdot \overrightarrow{d} \\
	E = C_{1} + \mu \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{C_{2}}} + \nu \cdot \overrightarrow{d_{C_{3}}} \quad &with \quad \overrightarrow{n_{E}} = \overrightarrow{d_{C_{2}}} \times \overrightarrow{d_{C_{3}}}
\end{align*}
A \texttt{Vector} $\overrightarrow{u}$ between $P_{I}$ and any other position on $E$ has to be perpendicular to $E$'s normal $\overrightarrow{n_{E}}$. Further, a \texttt{Vector} $\overrightarrow{w}$ from $V$'s origin to any position on $E$ is needed. It describes $V$'s origin with respect to $E$. In both cases, $C_{1}$ can be taken as a known position on the \texttt{Plane}.
$$\overrightarrow{u} = P_{I} - C_{1} \quad and \quad \overrightarrow{w} = P_{S} - C_{1}$$
As Figure \ref{fig:vector_plane_intersect} shows, going from $C_{1}$ to $P_{I}$ by $\overrightarrow{u}$ is the same as by $\overrightarrow{w}$ and then along $\overrightarrow{d}$. Since $P_{I} \in E$, $\overrightarrow{n}$ also stands perpendicular on $\overrightarrow{u}$. Hence, it is also perpendicular to its equal path from $C_{1}$ to $P_{I}$.
\begin{align*}
	\overrightarrow{u} = \overrightarrow{w} + \lambda_{I} \cdot \overrightarrow{d} \quad and \quad 0 &= \overrightarrow{n_{E}} \bullet \overrightarrow{u} \\
	\quad \Rightarrow \quad 0 &= \overrightarrow{n_{E}} \bullet (\overrightarrow{w} + \lambda_{I} \cdot \overrightarrow{d})
\end{align*}
This equation can be solved for $\lambda_{I}$, which is then put back into the pointing \texttt{Vector}'s equation.
\begin{align*}
	\lambda_{I} = \frac{\overrightarrow{n_{E}} \bullet \overrightarrow{w}}{\overrightarrow{n_{E}} \bullet \overrightarrow{d}} \quad in \quad P_{I} &= P_{S} + \lambda_{I} \cdot \overrightarrow{d} \\	
	\quad \to \quad P_{I} &= P_{S} + \frac{\overrightarrow{n_{E}} \bullet \overrightarrow{w}}{\overrightarrow{n_{E}} \bullet \overrightarrow{d}} \cdot \overrightarrow{d}
\end{align*}

The GeometryHandler-class utilizes the \ac{MS} XNA framework. It features specialized analysis functionality such as computation dot and cross products and the normal of a plane. These functions replaced manual calculations and increased the efficiency of the class.

The third feature of the GeometryHandler-class is classifying and weighing points and positions. As mentioned in Chapter \ref{installation_testing}, the focus of this work is not the investigation of \textit{biased free-hand pointing}, but the development of an interactive system using free-hand pointing.
\\
Pointing and aiming points and positions are classified by comparing each axis' values separately. In the current state, the biggest absolute value is considered the dominant value. The combined point or position is then computed by weighing the two inputs 70:30 in favour of the dominant value.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{CalibrationHandler.cs} Points, planes and positions of an \ac{IMI}-exhibition are defined and validated by the CalibrationHandler-class. Therefore, two members are used. The first stores the samples per position from which an administrative user is pointing. It is needed to organize the inputs of aiming and pointing \texttt{Vector}s. The other member saves the threshold for which points, planes and positions are defined and validated.

To define a \texttt{Plane}, three corners are needed. Those corners are points in \ac{3D} space. A Point is defined by pointing at it from different pointing locations. This way \texttt{Vector}s from various angles define what can be described as a \textit{cloud of intersections}. They are pedal points between every \texttt{Vector} with every other \texttt{Vector} and computed by an instance of the GeometryHandler-class . Since there are three pointing locations, there are also three \texttt{Vector}s for each corner. Hence, each corner's cloud consists of three pedal points. These pedal points are averaged to form a center point.
\\
This process is repeated to validate the once defined corners. Therefore, an administrative user defines the same corners again and the previously defined corners are compared to the newly defined validation corners by checking, whether they lie within the saved threshold. If every pair of corners validates each other, the \texttt{Plane} can be saved as the corresponding member of the \ac{IMI}-exhibition.

Defining the position of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit is similar to the definition of a corner. An admin points at the exhibit on the earlier defined exhibition plane. This is done from three different pointing locations. Only this time the GeometryHandler-instance does not calculate a pedal point, but the \texttt{Vector}s' intersections with the \texttt{Plane}. After that, a center of the three points is computed.
\\
A position on an \ac{IMI}-exhibit has to be validated as well. Hence, the defining processes is repeated and the two centers are compared according to the threshold of the respective \ac{IMI}-exhibition. If they validate each other, the position is saved for the particular \ac{IMI}-exhibit. 

Should corners or a position not successfully validate, the whole definition process has to be repeated all over again. Another validation round is not sufficient, because the first defined corners or position may be flawed.
\\
The definition and validation for both corners and positions are done for pointing and aiming. Thus, there are always two values for each corner or position. These two get classified, weighted and combined into one corner or position after validation. Hence, the reliability of a corner or position is higher, because only validation of both pointing modes yield validation of the combined corner or position value.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{SessionHandler.cs} All data necessary for interaction is computed by the SessionHandler-class. It determines a user from surrounding visitors and calculates whether a target is pointed at or not. Furthermore, this handler also calculates a user's \textit{feedback position} on the exhibition plane. Thus, a user is able to adjust his or her way of pointing.

For all these calculations the SessionHandler-class needs various members. To determine who is a user amongst visitors, the class stores the predefined user position of an \ac{IMI}-exhibition as a member upon initialization. Along this particular point it further saves the radius of the interaction space around the user position.
\\
Additional members that are necessary for interacting with the \ac{IMI}-exhibition are the exhibition plane, the screen and canvas\footnote{A canvas is an XAML-element on which the overview, exhibits' positions and later the feedback position are drawn. More about the process in Chapter \ref{implementation_presentation}.} size. The size of the feedback buffer is a constant member for smoothing a user's feedback position on the display. 

A short but important function is the determination of a user. Without the identification of a user, all further interaction is not possible. All trackable visitors recognized by the system have an \ac{ID}. A \texttt{Dictionary} with this \ac{ID} as \texttt{Key} and the respective person's hip-joint position as \texttt{Value} is given to a function. This function checks if any of the visitors' hips is within the interaction space defined by the \texttt{userPosition} and \texttt{radius}. It then returns the \ac{ID} of the user closest to the \ac{IMI}-exhibition's user position. Hence, the software knows the \ac{ID} of the user to further track and hence interact with.
\\
Intersections of \texttt{Vector} and \texttt{Plane} are calculated by the GeometryHandler, but the intersection is not enough. It has to be checked, if some target was hit or not. This task is done by the SessionHandler. It is very hard to hit just the position of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit. This is where the aforementioned kernel of an \texttt{Exhibit} comes into play. As depicted by Figure \ref{fig:exhibit_kernel}a the kernel defines an \textit{\ac{AOA}}. The closer an intersection is to the center of the \ac{AOA}, the higher the affinity for its corresponding \texttt{Exhibit}. Thus, the actual size of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit does not influence its selectability. Only its \ac{AOA}'s properties determine how well an \ac{IMI}-exhibit is selectable. Especially for densely arranged exhibits, this is a useful feature. A small but important object can be given a big kernel size and radius and hence attract more selections than a less important object in its direct proximity (see Figure \ref{fig:exhibit_kernel}b).

\textbf{F I G U R E}
%\begin{figure}%
%\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{filename}%
%\caption{.}%
%\label{fig:exhibit_kernel} %a) basic principle and b) comparison of big an small AOA 
%\end{figure}

To select a target, it has to be determined which \ac{AOA} has the strongest affinity for the position in question. Therefore, the affinity of each \texttt{Exhibit} at this position has to be calculated and it has to be distinguished which one's is the highest. To do that for th ewhole exhibition plane and all exhibits on it in real turned out to require a lot of computing power. Hence, the efficiency was improved by using a \textit{pre-processed lookup-table of all \ac{AOA}s}. Therefore, the \texttt{Plane} is rasterized by 1000 steps in each direction. In this case each step between the matrix dots is about 3mm. Then, the all affinities for each of the matrix dots are calculated. Subsequently, the index\footnote{All \texttt{Exhibit}s of an \texttt{Exhibition} are stored in a \texttt{List}.} of the \texttt{Exhibit} with the highest affinity is stored in a \textit{lookup table}. This lookup table is a \texttt{Dictionary} with a position as \texttt{Key} and the corresponding \texttt{Exhibit}'s index as \texttt{Value}. After all positions are processed, all positions referring to no \ac{IMI}-exhibit are removed from the lookup table. Thus, in this case, the number of \textit{pre-determined affinities} is reduced from 1.000.000 to about 50.000. Thereafter, affinities do not have to be computed each frame, but positions are compared\footnote{Pointing positions might not appear in the lookup table. Therefore, the closest position is interpolated.} with those in the lookup table. If there is a match, the corresponding index is returned.
\\
Every position a user is pointing at is buffered and a smoothened \textit{feedback position} is returned. This feedback position is already converted in \texttt{Canvas}-coordinates to match the dimensions of the overview. As Figure \ref{fig:plane_screen_canvas_coords} shows, \texttt{Plane}-coordinates have to be converted into \texttt{Canvas}-coordinates with the ratios of \texttt{Plane} to \texttt{Screen} to \texttt{Canvas} in mind. Depending on the ratio of the \texttt{Plane}, the ratio between \texttt{Screen} and \texttt{Canvas} changes.

%\end{figure}

The \texttt{planeCanvasRatio} is used to calculate the correct position for the representation of the feedback position in an \ac{IMI}-exhibition's overview. Moreover, it is also used to correctly scale and display the \ac{AOA} of each \texttt{Exhibit} it in the defined position on the overview.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{StatisticsHandler.cs} Statistical calculations are done by the StatisticsHandler-class. It computes the \textit{mean}, \textit{variance}, \textit{(empiric) standard deviation} and standard error for a sample of \texttt{Point3D} or \texttt{double}-values. This feature was used for informal analysis of raw data during the iterative development-process. Nevertheless, it might be used for more representative long-term evaluation. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{DataLogger.cs} The DataLogger-class can be used for saving all kinds of data of the \ac{IMI}-system. It was developed to write log-files in TXT-format. Therefore, it is possible to initiate an instance with only a file path. After that, new paragraphs can be set up with either a headline or no headline. These paragraphs can then be addressed with an index. Thus, new lines are addable at any point during the runtime of an \ac{IMI}-application. A logs can be saved as TXT-files anytime, too.
\\
The DataLogger-class was used during the iterative development-process to log pointing and aiming \texttt{Vector}s as well as defined points and positions in one file for each subject along with related statistics of these values.
\\
The presentation-software, uses the DataLogger-class to save all events during a session. Thus, the museum is able to keep track of its visitors' behavior and interests. These session-logs can be further analyzed by the \ac{IMI}-statistics tool described in Chapter \ref{implementation_tool}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Administration Software}
\label{implementation_administration}

An \ac{IMI}-exhibition and its exhibits are defined with a special tool. The software furthermore enables an administrative user to edit any \ac{IMI}-exhibition or its exhibits. Therefore, the administration software incorporates the functionality of \ac{IMI}-system's the depth sensor in order to define points and positions. External files such as images and texts can be loaded to enrich \ac{IMI}-exhibits. Moreover, properties crucial for interaction are also individually adjustable.

To define any point or position, the depth sensor's tracking date has to be usable in real time without compromising the \ac{GUI}. Thus, the sensor is only activated when it is needed. For the rest of the time, it is shut off. If tracking data are needed, a special thread is started. The tracking-thread is the standard \texttt{while}-loop provided by the \ac{FUBI} framework. During each cycle of the loop the depth sensor updates its tracking data. This data is then accessible by the \ac{GUI}-thread via functions of the \ac{FUBI} framework. However, this is not enough to define an exhibition plane or user position of an \ac{IMI}-exhibition or the position of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit. For defining any of these yet another thread is needed to make use of the tracking data. Therefore, the \texttt{calibrationThread} is used. It is one thread that starts either of the definition-methods mentioned above. Namely they are \texttt{definePlane}, \texttt{defineUserPosition} and \texttt{definePosition}. The definition of the exhibition plane and the definition of an exhibit's position both work quiet similar, whereas the definition of the user position is less complex. For the latter, an administrative user stands at the designated user position and the coordinates of the admin's hip-joint are saved. Defining a position on the exhibition plane or the plane itself is a more involving process.
\\
To define an exhibition plane, an administrative user has to be trackable. Otherwise, the button to start the process is not visible and thus cannot be pressed. When everything is in order and the button has been pressed, the \texttt{calibrationThread} calls the \texttt{definePlane}-function. This function is responsible for initiating the sampling-function and determine whether the \texttt{Plane} is defined for the first time or to validate the first attempt. In both cases, the function \texttt{sampleVectors} is called. To run, it needs the amount of points to define, the amount of pointing locations, the amount of \texttt{Vector}s sampled per pointing location and the \textit{sampling mode}. This mode determines, which kind of samples are taken\footnote{Either pointing or aiming \texttt{Vector}s are taken. The third sampling mode is to sample both, pointing and aiming \texttt{Vector}s simultaneously. The final \ac{IMI}-system works in this combined sampling mode to compute weighted points and positions as described in Chapter \ref{installation_testing}.}. The \texttt{sampleVectors}-function then initiates the definition process. Therefore, two nested \texttt{for}-loops are passed. Both loops provide the instructions for the admin on what to do next. They are displayed on the \ac{GUI} along with the corresponding ideograms. The outer loop addresses the pointing locations, while the inner one loops over the points to define. This means that the outer loop does three cycles, one for each pointing location. The inner loop does one cycle for each of the three corners. Hence, an administrative user has to go to a pointing location, point at each of the three corners and the move to the next pointing location and repeat the process until each corner has been pointed at from each pointing location. After the first definition, the whole routine to define the exhibition plane is repeated. For the second time the same exhibition plane is defined in order to validate the first ones proper definition. If either of the corners does not lie within the sufficient accuracy, the whole procedure has to be repeated. The same procedure applies for defining the position of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit. Only this time, there is only one position to define and not three points. Hence, the position is pointed at from three pointing locations twice to define and validate its value as described by Figure \ref{fig:def_position}.

%\end{figure}

After each definition the depth sensor is not needed anymore. Hence, both threads can be stopped. First the \texttt{calibrationThread} and then the \texttt{trackingThread} are aborted. The order is important, because otherwise there will be not tacking data to access and thus memory violations, which might cause the software to crash.

Not only exhibition planes and the position of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit can be defined with the administration software. The application also enables an administrative user to load particular files to enhance an \ac{IMI}-exhibition. While all \textit{changes are saved automatically}, external files have to be explicitly loaded. Files that can be loaded include images, text files and whole \ac{IMI}-exhibits as well.
\\
Images are used as the background for the stand by mode and the outlines of the \ac{IMI}-exhibition for the navigation mode of the presentation software. Furthermore, any detailed photograph of each \ac{IMI}-exhibit also has to be loaded manually. Images have to be of BMP-, JPG- or PNG-format.
\\
Instead of writing a description for an \ac{IMI}-exhibit, a previously constructed text can alternatively be loaded into the \texttt{textBox}. All files should be TXT-files and coded in UTF-8 to guarantee flawlessly displayed characters.
\\
It is possible to load already existing \ac{IMI}-exhibits as well. Even if they where defined in the context of another \ac{IMI}-exhibition, they can be loaded. Afterwards, they will be a valid part of the administered \ac{IMI}-exhibition. Nevertheless, certain changes might have to be done to properly include them into the new context. Their position might have to be re-defined in order to be selectable, if the exhibition plane or location of the depth sensor are different that before.

All properties of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit can be edited with the administration software. This includes the aforementioned properties that can be loaded, but also various other ones. Therefore, a special ''Properties'' section offers each editable property in a drop down menu. The properties vary in type. One the one hand, there are the radius and size of the kernel. Although these are continuous values, the input is restricted to three discreet states to avoid confusion. They are presented as textual entities ''low'', ''normal'' and ''high'' and hence more imaginable representations of a certain percentage of the default value. The low value is 50$\%$, the normal value is 100$\%$ and the high value 150$\%$ of the respective default value. On the other hand, there is the position of the exhibit itself. This value can be set by defining and validating it again like it is described above.
\\
The view displaying the properties' drop down-menu of an \ac{IMI}-exhibition can be reached with the same ''Properties''-button in the lower left corner of the \ac{GUI}'s view of the exhibition. An \ac{IMI}-exhibition has more properties than an \ac{IMI}-exhibit, because it has to regulate the interaction. Here, three types of values are editable. First, there are the two images that can be loaded from this view. Next, continuous values are adjustable as ''low'', ''normal'' and ''high''. They are the threshold to validate new positions, the dwell time for target selection, the time the tracking is paused after selectig a target and the time a slide is shown for. The final property is the user position. This value can be set by a person standing in the user position. Like the definition of any other point or position, the process can only be started, if the person is trackable.

\section{Presentation Software}
\label{implementation_presentation}

The presentation software is is the main interface of the \ac{IMI}-system. On the very first start of the application, an administrative user has to load the \ac{IMI}-exhibition that has to be presented from that moment on. The file path to the definition file of the \ac{IMI}-exhibition is then saved to a local text-file. To change the exhibition, the file path has to be changed to the definition file of another \ac{IMI}-exhibition. The old file path can also be deleted and the presentation software restarted to load the alternative \ac{IMI}-exhibition.
\\
After the start of the program, all the \ac{IMI}-exhibition are loaded. This includes all \ac{IMI}-exhibits and their external images as well. For proper interaction, the lookup table is computed and all the \ac{IMI}-exhibits' positions are converted into the corresponding positions on the overview of the exhibition plane to guarantee correct feedback.
\\
When all components of the \ac{IMI}-exhibition are initialized, the tracking thread of the depth sensor is started. Finally the application goes into the standby mode and waits for visitors. 

When at least one visitor enters the sensor's field of view and is recognized the system reacts. The instructions and ideogram are displayed to invite visitors to actively interact with the system and the \texttt{DataLogger} of the presentation software starts the recording of a new session. Furthermore, the software permanently updates a list of all trackable visitors. This list contains their \ac{ID}s. If a visitor is no longer trackable the corresponding \ac{ID} is removed from the list. 

The software is a state of active waiting. This means, every time the trackable users are updated so are the coordinated of their hip-joints. If a visitor follows the instruction and gets into the declared interaction space, he or she becomes the active user of the presentation software. The interaction space is marked by foot steps and defined by the \texttt{userPosition}-member of the \ac{IMI}-exhibition.
\\
Once there is a user, several things happen. First, the user's head-, elbow-, and hand-joints are updated by the software to compute pointing and aiming \texttt{Vector}s. In addition, the \texttt{DataLogger} records a ''Start Session''-event along with the exact time, ID of the user and amount of trackable visitors. Next, the navigational view is displayed to provide visual feedback of all the positions of \ac{IMI}-exhibits on the exhibition plane and the pointing position of the user, if it lies on the plane as well. Finally, the head,- elbow-, and hand-joints are updated to compute pointing and aiming \texttt{Vector}s.

For each cycle of the main tracking thread, the pointing and aiming \texttt{Vector}s' intersections with the exhibition plane are calculated and combined into a biased pointing position. This position is then twofoldly analyzed.
\\
First, the pointing position is put into the \texttt{feedbackPositionBuffer} and a buffered feedback position is displayed on the overview of the exhibition plane on the display. A buffer is necessary, because otherwise raw pointing positions tend to jitter a lot. This irritates users and causes frustration. 
The other process happening with the pointing position is to check, whether it hits a target. Therefore, the lookup table is checked by the \texttt{SessionHandler} as described in Chapter \ref{implementation_libraries}. If there is an entry and a corresponding index of an \ac{IMI}-exhibit, the index is returned as \textit{temporary target}. Else, the temporary target gets invalidated.

With updating the feedback position on the display, it is also checked, whether there is a new and valid target. Therefore, the temporary target is checked against the actually \textit{marked target}.

- (new) target marked? -> (re-)start selectionThread (countdown) -> EVENT new target
\\
- no target marked? -> stop selectionThread

- selectionThread finished -> select current target -> presentation of corresponding exhibit (load text to label and images into pictureBox) -> start ''slideShowThread'' -> EVENT selected target

- presentation over -> navigational view

- no more user -> EVENT end session
- no more visitors -> EVENT duration (session over) -> write log-file

\section{Presentation Remote}
\label{implementation_remote}

A remote to stop an resume the presentation software during guided tours war requested by the museum's staff. Therefore, it should be possible to switch the sensor off and stop tracking visitors. Hence, the presentation software would stay in its hibernation mode and the display would remain camouflaged.

Unfortunately, not finished by now...

But, hardware present and template project available...

\section{Statistics Tool}
\label{implementation_tool}
 
The presentation software saves a log-file of each session for and review purposes. These files can be analyzed with the statistics tool. Therefore, the tool only has two buttons. By pressing ''Load'', one or more log-files can be loaded into the tool and the amount of loaded files is displayed in a small label. All loaded files get analyzed by pressing ''Analyze''. Consecutively, the tool reads all files and parses them for relevant information. This process takes a few minutes. After parsing all files general statistics of the combined files are computed. The results are displayed within a label of the tool and written to a TXT-file.

The results include the \textit{involvement relation}. It is the relation between empty and evaluable sessions. In an empty session no interaction with the \ac{IMI}-system occurred. Inferences about the system's recognizability can be drawn from the involvement relation. A low quotient implies a low rate of interaction with the system and appropriate measures should be taken to increase recognizability.
\\
Afterwards, \textit{relevant times} are analyzed with respect to the longest, shortest and average length. The relevant times are the \textit{initiation time}\footnote{Here, initiation time is the time between activation of the system and the first interaction of a user.} and the \textit{total length} of a session measured from activation to departure. The first time indicates the visitors' inhibition to use the system, while the latter gives an overview of visitors' involvement with the system.
\\
Finally, \textit{exhibit selection} is reviewed. Therefore, two separate values are inspected. The amount of \textit{absolute selections} shows how often each \ac{IMI}-exhibit was selected over all. The ranking of selections implies visitors' general interest. \textit{Target transitions} are computed as well. A transition occurs when a target does not get selected, but instead another target gets marked. In this case, an \textit{external transition} between the two targets occurs. It might also happen that the pointing position of a user leaves a kernel and re-enters it immediately. Thus, the target also does not get selected, and there is an \textit{internal transition}. Transitions indicate difficulties in selecting certain targets. These targets are either hard to hit on their own or too close to another one. In both cases however, kernels of the \ac{IMI}-exhibits in question can be altered and/or the positions of those exhibits can be re-defined.
