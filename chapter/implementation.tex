\chapter{Implementation -- Interactive Museum Installation}
\label{implementation}

The \ac{IMI}-system consists of two main parts. First, the hardware, which involves the physical tracking and computing of that data in the background. Second, the software, which includes the \ac{IMI}-libraries and pieces of software utilizing them.

The hardware consists of and PC, the sensor, a screen and peripheral input devices for maintenance. The designated PC is an \textit{ASUS VIVO VC60-B013M}. It employs a \textit{Intel Core i5 3210M} with a clock speed of 2x2,5GHz and 4GB DDR3 SDRAM. Since the system does not have complex graphics, there was no need for a sophisticated graphics card. Hence, the PC is compact and does not need much electricity. 
\\
The Display is connected to the PC via USB3.0 and houses its own graphics chip. This configuration eased the installation, because...
