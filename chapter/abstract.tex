Museums can be perceived as old fashioned. Potential audiences therefore often do not consider visiting one for themselves. Nevertheless, there are many modern and open minded ones, which are willing to experiment with new possibilities, to get rid of their dusted reputation and to evolve.
\\
In order to increase interactive potential of exhibits behind glass, I implemented a novel information interaction system for a museum of pre- and protohistoric history. The challenge was not only to develop a working, intuitive prototype, but also consider low maintenance and robustness for everyday use. The system I developed employs the natural behavior of visitors by detecting potential users and enabling them to interact with the system via pointing gestures. Additionally, the museum personnel can easily set up and maintain the
system themselves.
\\
Interaction of the system is initiated automatically with a visitor walking up to the installation. No additional devices on the users
side are required, they only need to point at one of the interactive exhibits inside the showcase. The system then determines which exhibit is addressed and displays corresponding information in the form of explanatory texts and detailed images on a screen.

%Museums can be perceived as old fashioned. At least, that is what some people assume and therefore not even consider having a look for themselves. Nevertheless, there are many modern and open minded ones, which are willing to experiment with new possibilities, to get rid of their dusted reputation and to evolve.

%So, I was called to do exactly that. -- Implement a novel informatory interaction system for a museum of pre- and protohistoric history, where precious artifacts are locked up behind thick glass. The challenge was not only to develop a working prototype, but also make it intuitive, low maintenance and robust enough for everyday use. The system I developed employs the natural behavior of visitors. It detects potential users and enables them to interact with the system via pointing-gestures. Moreover, it easily can be set up and altered by museum personnel.
%\\
%A visitor can walk up to the installation and start the interaction right away. No devices are needed. The user only points at one of the interactive exhibits inside the showcase. The system then calculates, which exhibit is addressed and displays corresponding information in form of explanatory texts and detailed images.

%Three dimensional (3D) graphics are a common sight in modern media, while two dimensional techniques are widely used for interaction. In virtual reality, several 3D devices are used to navigate and manipulate the virtual contents. Nevertheless, they are often not easy to use or error prone. At the same time, home entertainment systems (i.e. Kinect) can be operated with simple hand gestures. Hence, a novel interaction prototype has been developed as an interactive museum information (IMI)-system. Here, users are tracked with an ASUS Xtion-motion sensor. Gestures can be analyzed using the OpenNI framework. By simply pointing at it, a user then describes ones interest in a specific exhibit and the software will provide further information regarding the exhibit. The IMI-System is a low cost and maintenance system. Thus, the museum's staff defines and edits the objects of interest and the corresponding information themselves.
