\section{Lab-setup}
\label{installation_lab}

A special lab had to be found and equipped with all necessary Hardware. The Hardware was lend to me by multiple sources of the faculty, while the museum's carpenter made a pedestal consisting of a surface and feet. The surface is made out of four 9mm-press boards. The feet seemed to unstable and thus were replaced with one desk rack for each board.
