\chapter{Setups and Hardware}
\label{installation}

Three installations were build. One lab-setup for development, one makeshift setup was placed in the faculties lobby, and the final one was installed inside the showcase in Museum für Ur- und Frühgeschichte Thüringens. The various setups differed more or less in dimensions and were run with different hardwares. Early tests were conducted with the lab-setup. The lobby-setup was used for a stress-test during an open door-event at the faculty, whereas the final evaluation took place in the museum. Then, only the presentation-software was tested.

\section{Lab-setup}
\label{installation_lab}

A special lab had to be found and equipped with all necessary Hardware. The Hardware was lend to me by multiple sources of the faculty, while the museum's carpenter made a pedestal consisting of a surface and feet. The surface is made out of four 9mm-press boards. The feet seemed to unstable and thus were replaced with one desk rack for each board.

\section{Lobby-setup}
\label{installation_lobby}

After some technical difficulties with the museum-setup, the first test under aggravated conditions was conducted during \textit{Summ\ae{}ry}\footnote{Summ\ae{}ry is an open door-event at the faculty of media, where all chairs present their work throughout the faculty-buildings.}. Therefore, I build a makeshift setup in the facultie's lobby. It consisted of three tables forming the exhibition plane and a bar table, on which the computer and a tripod with the sensor on top were positioned. There were three targets - a candy bar, a stack of coins, and a stack of fliers - lying on the plane (\textit{see Figure}).

\section{Final museum-setup}
\label{installation_museum}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Automatic boot at 8:30am [Bios]
	\item Runnging
	\item Logfiles for each \textit{Session-Event}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Start Session: User in interaction zone (Exhibition.UserPosition +/- Threshold from SessionHandler := 250mm)
		\item New Target: User pointing at a target
		\item Target Selected: Dwelltime (Exhibition.SelectionTime := 700ms) starts slide show for selected target
		\item End Session: User leaves interaction zone
	\end{itemize}
	\item Automatic shutdown at 4:45pm [Software]
\end{itemize}
