\chapter{Conception}
\label{conception}

After the \textit{Museum für Ur- und Frühgeschichte Thürigens} was chosen as a partner, all previous ideas had to be analyzed more thoroughly with feasibility in mind. Thus, impractical and too complex or too simple ideas were eliminated in two rounds of review. At first, vague ideas were either improved or discarded. Hence, a screen displaying only information about a fossilized fireplace was eliminated. The idea of a system for digitizing stone carvings was considered too complex to realize and therefor discarded as well. Afterward, some of the museum's staff and I looked at the contents, that could be provided for the remaining candidates. This left us with two remaining possibilities, that were promising enough from an educational and a technical standpoint. The first one was the reproduction of the \textit{Fürstengrab von Haßleben}, which contains replicas and original findings from a 1700 year old grave of a teutonic princess. A close second was a workshop, which should have shown how archeologists and preparateurs work behind the scenes of a museum. Here, the latter consisted of too many single parts and a lot of questions remained unanswered.

%\end{figure}

According to the aforementioned review, the Fürstengrab von Haßleben was most promising and therefore chosen in the end. It contains many special relics from ordinary, teutonic pottery to rare, roman coins and jewelry as shown in Figure \ref{fig:conception_grave}a,b and c. This apparent eclecticism is, what makes the grave so special though. It is a sublime showcase for thriving trade and cultural exchange between Teutons and Romans as far east as Thuringia. Further, it proves how Teutons began adapting roman traditions, such as burials. In order to emphasize this insight, an interactive system was to be developed.

\section{System presets}
\label{conception_system}

The system was to be developed and tested by me, and the museum-staff will be responsible for future its maintenance. Some visitors might not have the proper technical experiences to operate contemporary interfaces. Consequently, it was crucial to design the system with that in mind. It had to be operable by absolute lay persons, who have no prior experience concerning information technologies. Hence, the interface had to be as intuitive as possible. Four major points had to be considered.
\\
First, established and common input devices, such as keyboard and mouse, had to be replaced by something different. In order to be intuitive, the interaction was designed to capture and use the natural behavior of visitors. Outputs, on the other hand, had to be as discreet and as conservative as possible to not disturb or interfere with the exhibition. Thus, invasive technologies such as speakers and animatronics were excluded from the beginning. This consideration only left visual and haptic channels for output. The third point was, that daily operations at the museum were not to be compromised. So, it was not possible to develop the prototype inside the Haßleben-showcase itself and a full-size mockup had to be build somewhere else. Therefore, I measured the showcase and acquired a room in which a mockup could be placed for the prototype's implementation and testing\footnote{For a further description of the lab-setup see chapter \ref{installation_lab}}. Finally, the system's components, in- and output devices, had to be robust enough to cope with daily use. Moreover, they should also stay in their intended place. This meant attaching them to the showcase in some way of form.
\\
In summary, the requirements for the final system were narrowing down the possibilities right from the beginning. Hence, we came up with more than on idea and followed up on them, until one promised to be the most feasible.

\section{Constraints and capabilities}
\label{conception_constraints}

\paragraph{Demo} 

The early idea behind this work was to work with \ac{MS} Gadgeteer to develop a tangible interface for and with a museum. Thus, we first thought about how to include those Gadgeteer-modules. Therefore, I build the demo device shown in Figure \ref{?}, which was based on a \textit{FEZ Spider Starter Kit}~\cite{SpiderKitGHI}. In addition, it utilized an \ac{RFID}-reader~\cite{RFIDreaderGHI} and a potentiometer~\cite{PotentiometerGHI}. The RFID-transponders were attached to an old 2,5" \ac{HDD} and a wireless mouse. When the \ac{RFID}-tags were recognized, an image of the object was displayed on the screen. By turning the potentiometer's knob the angle of view changed accordingly. This gave an impression of the possibilities of the hardware. Unfortunately, we only had two \ac{RFID}-tags that had the size of a credit card. After some research though, I found some tags for the correct frequency band and in sizes from a grain of rice over credit cards to key chains~\cite{RFIDtransponder}. Hence, including \ac{RFID}-tags in tangibles was feasible. Only the shape and size of the tangibles were still up for debate.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Tangibles}

The main point was, whether the hardware would be placed inside or outside the tangibles. This decision dictates the shape and size of the tangibles and therefore the interaction.
\\
If it would be placed inside, the tangibles would have to be big. They would have turned out at approximately the size of a box of milk. Such an \textit{active tangible} would be handy and a whole system could be concentrated in one device. On the other hand, they would be prone to damage and maybe even theft. Hence, the tangibles would have to be tough and in some way attached to the showcase. In addition, batteries would have to be either charged or changed. This would take a certain amount of maintenance.
\\
With the Hardware outside the tangibles and hidden in a pedestal in front of the showcase, the tangibles could be smaller. Moreover, \textit{passive tangibles} grant more flexibility concerning the shape as well. Several \ac{RFID}-tags could be placed in each tangible. According to their \textit{constrained} position on the \ac{RFID}-reader could trigger different reactions of the system~\cite{TangibleUI}. The tangibles would have to be attached to the pedestal as well, although they would be less expensive to replace.

Both approaches had their advantages and disadvantages and none of them was concrete enough to make a decision. Thus, we continued to specify the concepts depending on their strengths and weaknesses. We did this, by anticipating probable relations between the exhibits inside and the behavior of visitors outside the showcase. There are several things visitors tend to do, if they are interested in an exhibit. They would like to inspect it up close. First, this means they would like to touch an exhibit and feel it. Second, they want to see it in more detail and from different angles. Next and induced by restrictions, visitors talk about an exhibit or  request further information. This could be anything from its age to where and how it was found.
\\
An active tangible could provide nearly all of those qualities in one package. It could - like the demo device - be fitted with a display and an \ac{RFID}-reader. The corresponding \ac{RFID}-tags could then be placed close to the device in order to trigger a particular output. Those outputs could be saved either on the device itself or provided by a server. The question of how to trigger different reactions was to be answered next. The device could either be placed on a pedestal equipped with \ac{RFID}-tags or the tags had to be brought to the reader in any other way. As mentioned earlier, an active tangible would be sizable and it would have to be related to the showcase's topic as well. Hence, it would be reasonable to combine those two criteria and produce enlarged reproductions of exhibits from the showcase. In order to fit the whole hardware, an active tangible would have to have a simple shape. This unfortunately excluded several of the more interesting exhibits, such as coins, a golden ring and other jewelry. Some templates remained though. There was a skull, pottery and the metal remains of two jewelry boxes.
\\
The passive tangibles did not appear to cause this much consideration. Any exhibit could have been \ac{3D} scanned\footnote{The scans could have been done in the labs of the chair of Computer Vision and Engineering at Bauhaus-Universität Weimar.}, turned into a digital model, appropriately altered to fit an \ac{RFID}-tag and then printed or milled out. The printed or milled reproduction could be used as a positive to produce casting molds, afterwards. Thus, replacing damaged or otherwise lost tangibles would be more cost-efficient. In addition, it could be done by the museum-staff themselves. One or more \ac{RFID}-readers could be placed in a pedestal in front of the showcase. Depending on the \ac{RFID}-reader and a tangible's tag, the system would display the corresponding output.
\\
During those considerations, a third possibility came up. A hybrid approach that combined both principles was possible as well. The reproduction of a jewelry box could be turned into an active tangible and passive tangibles could be put inside to trigger an output. The \ac{RFID}-reader would be placed underneath the box's floor and the display in the lid. In order to provide different types of content, we thought about also producing two different types boxes. A more or less \textit{authentic reconstruction} made of wood and metal fittings could provide authentic information about a passive tangible's cultural background. Meanwhile, the other box could be constructed of transparent material, which would allow the user to see the hardware. This \textit{futuristic reconstruction} could provide statistical content for the same passive tangible.

However, the main problem remained with all approaches. Some kind of pedestal would have to be build and placed outside the showcase to hold the active and/or passive tangibles. Although passive tangibles would have been more cost-efficient to replace than active ones, maintenance was rated too high. Furthermore, if the pedestal was not to obscure the showcase, it would have been too low\footnote{The height of the showcase floor is about 65cm. For more details see chapter \ref{installation}.} to grant satisfactory access for any visitor.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Tangible pointing}

As a result of the earlier drawbacks, we tried to minimize the objects outside the showcase. Hence, the display should be put inside. Since the display should not interfere with the exhibits or occlude them, we had to make decisions about the position, size and type of the display. In order to not occlude exhibits the display should not be placed among the exhibits or directly behind the glass panel. It could be placed along the visitors peripheral view though. This way, it would still imply coherence through visual proximity. A monitor on the one hand, and a projector on the other were two possible technologies to choose from. Both came with their own challenges. While a projector would have been easier to conceal than a monitor, a monitor would produce less heat an noise. Because most of the visitors approach the showcase from the long side an tend to stay there for most of the time, the display should be visible from this direction. This meant placing the projection plane or display on the opposing wall. Another solution for a projector came up during this consideration. A \ac{PDLC} switchable film~\cite{PDLC} could have been placed on the glass panel. Whenever the system was activated, the film and projector could have been activated as well\footnote{A \ac{PDLC} switchable film can be switched between a transparent and an opaque state. In its opaque state, it can be very well be used as a projection surface~\cite{PDLC}.}. Unfortunately, this solution was to expensive and difficult to install. A projection in the other direction was also disregarded, because the cost and heat issues caused by a projector were considered to high. Therefore, we decided to install an LED-screen. It should be placed inside the showcase close to the exhibits but not among them.

Like \textit{object selection in \ac{VR}-environments}~\cite{VRObjectSelectionCnG} and the \textit{SMSlingshot}~\cite{SMSlingshot}, a \textit{pointing device} seemed to meet this requirement. This way, a potential user could directly point at the original exhibits to gain additional information about it. As described in detail in chapter \ref{evaluation}, this also made use of the natural behavior of visitors. I observed interactions between visitors and the showcase as well as between each other. It turned out that they often pointed at the particular exhibits they were talking about. The interface could be designed to emulate this natural interaction between visitors. 
\\
The first intention was to rebuild the SMSlingshot with Gadgeteer-hardware. The tangible was equipped with a microcontroller, a small display, a keyboard, a green laser, a wireless transmitter and of course batteries. A PC was used to put all the information together and render the output. Therefore, it had a camera to track the point a user was aiming at and a corresponding transmitter to receive the fired messages~\cite{SMSlingshot}. All those modules could be provided by Gadgeteer except the laser. A laser could have been controlled with a \textit{Breakout module}~\cite{BreakoutGHI} and a relay. However, shooting a laser into the showcase was a delicate issue. Hence, this solution had to be revisited, because for safety reasons it was not feasible. There could have been injuries of visitors' eyes or some of the precious exhibits might have reacted to the laser's energy in a corrosive way. We did not want to take those risks, but we were very keen on the idea of pointing interaction. Thus, I looked for other tracking methods. We could have used a tracking system similar to the aforementioned ones used in \ac{VR}. Those systems are expensive to install and maintain though. Moreover, a proper compatibility with Gadgeteer was doubtful. So, I started looking for alternatives to Gadgeteer, too. Two established systems immediately came to mind. First, the \textit{Nintento Wii}, which uses a wireless device with pointing capabilities and additional inputs. Second, the \textit{\ac{MS} Kinect}, which is able to recognize gestures and might not require any device. Both are comparably inexpensive to acquire, have experienced support and communities and use less dangerous \ac{IR} light.
\\
The decision between the two was made according to the same criteria as mentioned above. Pointing with no device should be a more intuitive way to interact with the exhibition and other visitors than any handheld device. Furthermore, the restraint to use the system should be reduced. No tangible or pedestal would have to be created and attached to the showcase, which decreased cost for maintenance. Hence, the \ac{MS} Kinect was chosen.


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Pointing}

There is a Kinect for \ac{MS} Windows along with a special \ac{SDK} for \ac{MS} Visual Studio. As it turned out, the hardware inside the \ac{MS} Kinect was developed by \textit{PrimeSense} and is also used by the \textit{ASUS Xtion PRO}. This \ac{3D}-sensor is less expensive and smaller, which allows to be less intrusive inside the showcase. Besides, we already had some of them at the faculty, which meant that I could start developing right away. Another change was the decision for an open source \ac{SDK} called \textit{OpenNI}\footnote{OpenNI was co-founded by PrimeSense, a hardware developer that produces \ac{3D} sensing hardware. In November 2013 PrimeSense was bought by Apple, whereupon OpenNI was shut down.}, which in combination with its add-on \textit{NiTE} would enable me to use \textit{skeleton tracking}. This was critical for my approach, because I needed to have a \ac{3D} vector in order to be able to calculate where a user was pointing. Skeleton tracking would deliver the joints of a tracked person. Hence, I should get the directions a limb is oriented in. If this vector was extended, I could calculate its possible intersection with an exhibit. More about used software and the exact calculations can be found in the next chapter.

The last topic that needed addressing was \textit{feedback}. Since there would be no haptic or acoustic feedback, and no \textit{glowing dot} produced by a laser either, future users would need another visual feedback in order to be able to see where they were pointing and determine how to correct that. Once more, Gadgeteer could have provided a solution. Our first idea was to simulate the glowing dot by a spotlight. The system would calculate the position a user was pointing at and transmit it to a Gadgeteer-system. It would then move a special highlight to this position within the showcase. Only two actuators would be sufficient. The maintenance of this kind of installation could become very complicated though, because the system would have to be installed on the ceiling of the showcase. Actuators need to be calibrated regularly and gearing will wear out. Hence, this implementation was declined. Nevertheless, the principle should remain the same. Thus, the aforementioned position would now be shown on an overview of the showcase on the display.

\section{Final concept}
\label{conception_final}

%\textbf{Soll ich hier nochmal das Gesamtkonzept zusammenfassen oder ist es besser, das Organisatorische noch etwas mehr zu vertiefen und dafür das fertige System im Implementation-Kapitel genau zu erklären? -- Dann muss ich hier nochmal die Überschrift ändern.}

The final system would consist of a \textit{depth sensor}, \textit{PC} and \textit{display}. This hardware would be placed inside the showcase. In addition, an active tangible to remotely activate and deactivate the system should be developed as well. It is only intended to be a feasibility study, which determines if and how active tangibles might be incorporated into the system. Suitable components would be recommended by me and provided by the museum according to a mutual agreement.
\\
The system would have to work as follows. When one or more visitors enter the area in front of the showcase the system would recognize them and react in an inviting fashion. An interaction zone would be declared from where one user would be able to interact with the interface by pointing at an exhibit. The exhibition could be defined by museum-staff themselves. Therefore, an exhibition plane would have to be defined and validated as well as the exhibits' positions on it. This would be executable by the staff and pointing at the required positions as well. Furthermore, the staff would provide the corresponding contents such as images and explanatory texts. 

The final concept all parties agreed on was written down by me in a Functional Specification Document (\ac{FSD}) and responsibilities were covered by a contract. 

The \ac{FSD} states, which features of the final system must, should and must not be implemented and working.

\paragraph{Necessary features - ''Musts''}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system has separate modes for administration and presentation of an exhibition.
	\item Visual feedback of the interaction will be provided on the display.
	\item The system recognizes visitors and only one user can interact with it at a time.
	\item The system will be maintainable by the museum's staff and will start and shut down automatically.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Preferable features - ''Shoulds''}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There should be a system's manual.
	\item It should be possible to switch the system into a 'blind' mode for guided tours.
	\item Extensive exhibits should have a slide show.
	\item The system is operable with either the left or right hand.
	\item Statistics about the system's use should be logged.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Necessary features - ''Must nots''}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The will be no recognition of gestures.
	\item The system will not controll the lighting inside the showcase.
	\item There will be no auditive feedback.
	\item There will not be any tangibles.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, the \ac{FSD} describes system requirements, data formats and other organizational parameters. 

The contract was drawn up by the university's layer's office and later signed by the museum's director, my professor and me. Both documents can be found in the appendix.

\section{Testing}
\label{conception_testing}

Before anything could be installed or evaluated, a reliable system had to be developed. Therefore, I researched suitable environments for an extensible system. Because most \ac{SDK}s for PrimeSense's hardware are implemented in C++ or C\# and Gadgeteer uses Microsoft's .NET framework and C\#, the final system should be implemented in C\#. Thus, an \ac{SDK} written in C\# was to be found. After having tried several open source frameworks, the \ac{FUBI} developed at Universität Augsburg proved to fit our needs best. \ac{FUBI} came with a C\#-wrapper, which incorporated all functionality of OpenNI and NiTE that was necessary to achieve our goals. Moreover, its leading developer, \textit{Dipl.-Inf. Felix Kistler}, kindly explained how to incorporate the new approach to \ac{FUBI}.
