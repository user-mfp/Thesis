\chapter{Conception}
\label{conception}

After the \textit{Museum für Ur- und Frühgeschichte Thürigens} was chosen as a partner, all previous ideas had to be analyzed more thoroughly with feasibility in mind. Thus, impractical and too complex or too simple ideas were eliminated in two rounds of review. At first, vague ideas were either improved or discarded. Hence, a screen displaying only information about a fossilized fireplace was eliminated. The idea of a system for digitizing stone carvings was considered too complex to realize and therefor discarded as well. Afterward, some of the museum's staff and I looked at the contents, that could be provided for the remaining candidates. This left us with two remaining possibilities, that were promising enough from an educational and a technical standpoint. The first one was the reproduction of the \textit{Fürstengrab von Haßleben}, which contains replicas and original findings from a 1700 year old grave of a teutonic princess. A close second was a workshop, which should have shown how archeologists and preparateurs work behind the scenes of a museum. Here, the latter consisted of too many single parts and a lot of questions remained unanswered.

According to the aforementioned review, the Fürstengrab von Haßleben was most promising and therefore chosen in the end. It contains many special relics from ordinary, teutonic pottery to rare, roman coins and jewelry as shown in Figure \ref{conception_grave}. This apparent eclecticism is, what makes the grave so special though. It is a sublime showcase for thriving trade and cultural exchange between Teutons and Romans as far east as Thuringia. Further, it proves how Teutons began adapting roman traditions, such as burials. In order to emphasize this insight, an interactive system was to be developed.

\section{System presets}
\label{conception_system}

The system was to be developed and tested by me, and the museum-staff will be responsible for future its maintenance. Some visitors might not have proper technical experiences to operate contemporary interfaces. Consequently, it was crucial to design the system with that in mind. It had to be operable by absolute lay persons, who have no prior experience concerning information technologies. Hence, the interface had to be as intuitive as possible. Four major points had to be considered.
\\
First, established and common input devices, such as keyboard and mouse, had to be replaced by something different. In order to be intuitive, the interaction was designed to capture and use the natural behavior of visitors. Outputs, on the other hand, had to be as discreet and as conservative as possible to not disturb or interfere with the exhibition. Thus, invasive technologies such as speakers and animatronics were excluded from the beginning. This consideration only left visual and haptic channels for output. The third point was, that daily operations at the museum were not to be compromised. So, it was not possible to develop the prototype inside the Haßleben-showcase itself and a full-size mockup had to be build somewhere else. Therefore, I measured the showcase and acquired a room in which a mockup could be placed for the prototype's implementation and testing\footnote{For a further description of the lab-setup see chapter \ref{installation_lab}}. Finally, the system's components, in- and output devices, had to be robust enough to cope with daily use. Moreover, they should also stay in their intended place. This meant attaching them to the showcase in some way of form.
\\
In summary, the requirements for the final system were narrowing down the possibilities from the beginning. Hence, we came up with more than on idea and followed up on them, until one promised to be the most feasible.

\section{Constraints and capabilities}
\label{conception_constraints}

\paragraph{Demo} The early idea behind this work was to work with \ac{MS} Gadgeteer to develop a tangible interface for and with a museum. Thus, we first thought about how to include those Gadgeteer-modules. Therefore, I build a demo in Figure \ref{?}, which was based on a \textit{FEZ Spider Starter Kit}~\cite{SpiderKitGHI}. In addition, it utilized an \ac{RFID}-reader~\cite{RFIDreaderGHI} and a potentiometer~\cite{PotentiometerGHI}. The RFID-transponders were attached to an old 2,5" \ac{HDD} and a wireless mouse. When the \ac{RFID}-tags were recognized, an image of the object was displayed on the screen. By turning the potentiometer's knob the angle of view changed accordingly. This gave an impression of the possibilities of the hardware. Unfortunately, we only had two \ac{RFID}-tags that had the size of a credit card. After some research though, I found some tags for the correct frequency band and in sizes from a grain of rice over credit cards to key chains~\cite{RFIDtransponder}. Hence, including \ac{RFID}-tags in tangibles was feasible. Only the shape and size of the tangibles were still up for debate.

\paragraph{Tangibles}

The main point was, whether the hardware would be placed inside or outside the tangibles. This decision dictates the shape and size of the tangibles and therefore the interaction.
\\
If it would be placed inside, the tangibles would have to be big. They would have turned out at approximately the size of a box of milk. Such an \textit{active} tangible would be handy and a whole system could be concentrated in one device. On the other hand, they would be prone to damage and maybe even theft. Hence, the tangibles would have to be tough and in some way attached to the showcase. In addition, batteries would have to be either charged or changed. This would take a certain amount of maintenance.
\\
With the Hardware outside the tangibles and hidden in a pedestal in front of the showcase, the tangibles could be smaller. Moreover, \textit{passive} tangibles grant more flexibility concerning the shape as well. Several \ac{RFID}-tags could be placed in each tangible. According to their \textit{constrained} position on the \ac{RFID}-reader could trigger different reactions of the system~\cite{TangibleUI}. The tangibles would have to be attached to the pedestal as well, although they would be cheaper to replace.

Both approaches had their advantages and disadvantages and none of them was concrete enough to make a decision. Thus, we continued to specify possible concepts.
