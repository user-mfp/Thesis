\chapter{Background and Motivation}
\label{motivation}

Over time public places became more and more enriched with all kinds of technology. Nowadays, on nearly every corner something is beeping or blinking and buttons, leavers and knobs make us - their potential users - interact with our environment. This trend does not spare anyone or anything. Even traditionally calm and sophisticated places open up to the possibilities of contemporary technologies.

\section{Museums}
\label{motivation_museums}

Museums, much like libraries, are foremost seen as a place of knowledge and its preservation. Hence, visitors behave in a very reserved manner. Whilst applying for libraries, museums are willing to involve people instead of merely providing information. Many Museums therefor employ guides, who give tours and tell visitors about the exhibits. In addition to their factual knowledge, they also provide interesting anecdotes and other exciting information needed to bond with a certain topic. Apart of instructive and teaching staff, museums have tried many other ways to involve their visitors. One of those is employing technology. With time technology evolved, and so did technological augmentations in museums.
\\
It started with panoramas, dioramas and later simple mechanics, which moved models. After that basic electronics were included, which illuminated particular exhibits. Microchips and computers became more and more popular and affordable. So, the technological equipment of museums grew with what was available. 
\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Audio Guides
	\item Info-Terminals w/ Touch Screen
	\item and so on...
\end{itemize}
Another chapter was opened, when the internet and wireless communication were introduced. Burgard et al. build an autonomous tour-guide robot and  called it \textit{RHINO} [Bur98]. It was able to navigate through the museum freely and without bumping into visitors. It could be used as a tour-guide for present visitors as well as for visitors on the internet, because it had a simple build-in web interface. RHINO was deployed at the \textit{Deutsches Museum Bonn} in 1998.
\\
In 2002, a group from the \textit{University of Limmerick} made a survey in \textit{Hunt Museum}. The museum is owned and run by the Hunt-family. Its tradition is to involve the visitors since its early days. Therefor, they had so-called \textit{cabinets of curiosity} [Cio02], special compartments within the exhibition, where additional exhibits were hidden. For example, a curious visitor had to open drawers in order to find a collection of plates. Via this exploration, the visitors became involved. Inspired by their observations, Ciolfi et al. implemented a completely new and interactive part of the exhibition in 2005 [Cio05]. Two new rooms were introduced. First, there was the \textit{study room} with three interactive devices for getting further information about certain exhibits. They were disguised as a chest, a painting and a desk. The second room, the \textit{room of opinion}, was plain white with plinths, on which visitors could record their interpretations of the intended function of certain exhibits. In  order to manage all the data, a third and hidden room was used to host all the data-servers.
\\
The \textit{medien.welten}-exhibition at \textit{Technisches Museum Wien} was not only showcasing technical devices from all eras and genres of modern media, it also invited visitors to make use of some. As Hornecker et al. described, throughout the exhibition users were given opportunities to produce their own medial content. The interfaces ranged from an abacus over a telegraph to a whole rebuild of a news-studio from an Austrian TV-channel. Visitors could not only use the devices, but store some of their produced contents in a \textit{digital backpack} [Hor06]. This way, visitors did not only have an exciting experience, but also something to remember it by later.

%It may have started with simple mechanics, which moved some models, and later included basic electronics, which illuminated particular exhibits.
