\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

The \ac{IMI}-system in its final configuration was developed to be a reliable for every day use and easy to maintain. Although tests in the controlled environment of the lab were promising, it had to proof itself in a realistic scenario. Therefore, the \ac{IMI}-system was installed inside the Haßleben-showcase. Afterwards, the \ac{IMI}-exhibition about the showcase was defined by the museum staff and me. The staff was responsible for descriptive texts, detailed images and the overview sketch for proper feedback. Meanwhile, I assisted during the definition of the exhibition plane and the exhibits' positions.
\\
However, in order to determine, whether or not the \ac{IMI}-system raised awareness for the topic of the showcase a pre-study had to be made. Therefore, the behavior of visitors around the un-augmented showcase had to be observed. In addition, their awareness of the showcase's contents had to be found out as well. Upon this baseline, behavior of visitors with the \ac{IMI}-system present could be evaluated.
\\
A true insight could only be gained by examining how the \ac{IMI}-system would be accepted by visitors over a longer period of time. Furthermore, they should not be influenced by as less unusual circumstances as possible.

The observation and questioning of visitors mostly leads to qualitative data. This data has to be evaluated differently than quantitative data gained from experimental research. Thus, methods of \textit{grounded theory} were employed to do so. In experimental research, a hypothesis leads to a study that produces data, which is then used to either accept or reject the hypothesis. Meanwhile, grounded theory first collects data from a study. This data is then used to shape a conclusive theory~\cite{GroundedTheory}. A comparison of the two different evaluation methods can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:experiment_vs_grounded}.

The qualitative data of the studies conducted at the Haßleben-showcase are descriptive notes of the behavior of visitors and transcripts of their answers during the subsequent interview. To evaluate the collected data methods of grounded theory were used. The grounded theory method consists of four general stages~\cite{GroundedTheory}. The first stage is \textit{open coding}. Here, the texts are analyzed and interesting characteristics are identified. Each characteristic is then coded by a distinctive term. In the next stage, related terms are combined as a concept. After the \textit{development of concepts}, those concepts can be further grouped during the  \textit{categorization}-stage. The fourth and final stage is the \textit{formation of a theory}. In our case, however, a weak theory was already available. Nevertheless, this theory could be improved after the pre-study.
\\
In retrospect, we followed a hybrid approach of experimental research and the grounded theory method, where qualitative data is evaluated to specify and improve an existing theory. Furthermore, the pre-study did have an influence on the implementation of the \ac{IMI}-system and the definition of the \ac{IMI}-exhibition of the Haßleben-showcase itself.

The observations of visitors around the Haßleben-showcase already had the purpose to gain a basic understanding of visitors' interaction. In contrast to grounded theory, the basic theory that \textbf{interaction with exhibits of a showcase raises the awareness about it and its contents} had already been assumed. This means, that casual engagement with a topic increases the knowledge about it.
\\
Related observations have been made with an interactive installation at the Science Museum in London, where visitors, mostly children, were invited by the installation to interact with it. Therefore, a user had to perform different gestures to trigger an animation. Feedback was given in textual and verbal form~\cite{Engagement}. After analyzing their observations with the methods of grounded theory, Haywood an Cairns among other things concluded that
\textit{
\begin{quote}
''engagement with the exhibit does have parallels with what is needed for successful learning, and this was not previously known.''\textnormal{~\cite{Engagement}}
\end{quote}}
Since, the Museum für Ur- und Frühgeschichte Thüringens is regularly visited by classes learning about the Roman age, a similar learning effect was striven for.

During the observations of the studies, the interaction of visitors with the showcase itself and amongst each other was observed and noted. Further, the size of a group of visitors along with their age were noted as well. In some cases the age of visitors had to be estimated. The time visitors spend around the Haßleben-showcase was also measured to be later taken as an indicator for the engagement of the visitors. A correlation of time spend with the showcase as a measure for engagement and the elaborateness of the answers could reveal supportive conclusions, later. When visitors left the \textit{Haßleben-room}, they were asked about the showcase. The intention was to gain information about their grade of awareness considering the Haßleben-showcase. Therefore, a \textit{semi-structured interview} with each group of visitors leaving the Haßleben-room was conducted.
\\
I further stated that the awareness considering a showcase can be graded into the following three stages:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Awareness of its \textbf{mere existence}.
	\item Awareness of its \textbf{general composition}.
	\item Awareness of its \textbf{specific composition}.
\end{enumerate}  

Hence, my questions were intended to grade each group of visitors with respect to those stages. In the end of the interview visitors were asked about their visiting habits concerning museum. 

The questions were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ''Can you remember the grave of the princess of Haßleben?''
	\item ''What can you remember? -- What objects were on display?''
	\item ''What is, in your opinion, shown in the image?''\footnote{An image of a \textit{jewel box} positioned by the feet of the princess from the Haßleben-showcase was shown to the visitors.}
	\item ''What would you change (positive or negative)?''
	\item ''What were you especially interested in? What would you like to know more about?''
	\item ''Did you read the grave's explanatory text?''
	\item ''On what occasions do you usually visit museums and how often?''
\end{itemize}
All observations and answers were noted in a protocol-sheet. A summarizing table of all the answers can be seen in the Appendix of this work.

\section{Pre-Study}
\label{evaluation_pre}

The Haßleben-showcase is at the beginning of the second room on the second floor of the museum. Visitors frontally approach it when thez walk through the door. There are several related showcases in the room. Among them is a coffin in the middle of the room. In the following room, the topic changes. There is a pottery oven in the corner and a bench on front of it. The layout of the rooms can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:hassleben_pottery_layout}. From the bench, I observed visitors in the previous room with the Haßleben-showcase in it. To disguise myself, I had one of the museum's audio guides\footnote{The Museum für Ur- und Frühgeschichte Thüringens offers audio guides for free. Visitors only have to leave a deposit. The audio guide is an app installed on an iPod Touch. It provides brief information about certain showcases and exhibits. They are identified by a sticker with the number of the corresponding audio track on it. The audio guide has German and English versions of each track.} with me.

\paragraph{Observations} The pre-study took place from December 18th to 20th 2013 and on January 2nd and 3rd 2014. As museum staff explained, according to their experience the museum is usually well frequented during these dates. During the time of the pre-study, there were two school classes visiting the museum on field trips. A fifth grade could only be observed while walking through the museum. A sixth grade on the other hand, used a workbook provided by the museum. At the time, their topic in class was the Roman age. After their visit of the second floor, they were divided into groups of three or four pupils and given the protocol-sheets as a questionnaire. However, their answers are not taken into consideration here, because the class spent 45 minutes on the 2nd floor and the were not interviewed as the remaining subjects. Nevertheless, both classes' feedback is still noted in the summarizing table, but will not be included in the following analysis.
\\
In total, 53 visitors were encountered during the observations. The oldest visitor was 70 and the youngest 4 years of age. All visitors together had an average age of 24 years and four months. The distribution of the whole sample is depicted by the scatter plot in Figure \ref{fig:pre-study_ages}.

Those 53 visitors were distributed over 19 groups. Here, the smallest group was a single person, while the largest group included six visitors. The average group size lay between two an three members. Figure \ref{fig:pre-study_groups} shows the overall group sizes.

%\end{figure}

Visitors were observed and interviewed as a group and not individually. Thus, the following answers were given by all individuals of a group and evaluated as the answer of the group. In some cases multiple answers were allowed.
\\
An accurate measurement of the length of stay \ac{LOS} for each group was not feasible. Hence, the groups' time with the Haßleben-showcase were categorized into intervals. Table \ref{tab:pre-study_los} shows the distribution of \ac{LOS} of all observed groups. For one group, a \ac{LOS} was \ac{n/s}.
\begin{table}[H]

	\begin{tabular}{ bl !{\vrule width 1pt} nr }

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\ac{LOS} of groups during the pre-study.}
	\label{tab:pre-study_los}
\end{table}
Overall, the observed groups tended to spent less than a minute at the Haßleben-showcase.
\\
The interaction of visitors with the showcase can be put into three categories. They imply ascending engagement with the exhibits and hence the topic. The first classified observations can be categorized as \textit{indifferent engagement}, where visitors appeared tired or uninterested. The second category includes \textit{appropriate engagement} in the showcase. Here, visitors were looking at the exhibits, but did nothing further. Lastly, \textit{increased engagement} was also observed. Different members of a group act differently around the exhibition. Hence, there are more values than groups in this section of the evaluations. 
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ bl !{\vrule width 1pt} nr }

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Interaction of visitors with the Haßleben-showcase during the pre-study.}
	\label{tab:pre-study_interaction_exhib}
\end{table}
Visitors interact with each other more than with a static showcase. Again, there is more than one way of interacting within a group of visitors. There might also be no observable interaction at all. Moreover, there were two lone visitors among the observed groups. Hence, there was no possible interaction with any one else and only the interaction between 51 visitors from 17 groups is listed in Table \ref{tab:pre-study_interaction_group}.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ bl !{\vrule width 1pt} nr }

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Interaction within groups of visitors during the pre-study.}
	\label{tab:pre-study_interaction_group}
\end{table}
Like the interaction with the showcase, classified behavior has been categorized into two main categories. The first regards the \textit{movement of groups}. They can move as a closed group or break up into sub-groups and then reunite somewhere. Moreover, lose connections between visitors were also observed, where visitors mostly moved as individuals.
\\
The second category is \textit{interaction} and is divided into two sub-categories. First, \textit{verbal interaction} includes all spoken forms of interaction. The other form of observed interaction is \textit{gestural interaction}. Visitors were mostly pointing to emphasize what they were talking about. Also other gestures like describing the shape of an exhibit were observed.

\paragraph{Interviews} After a group left the area of the Haßleben-showcase, they were approached and asked, whether they would answer a number of questions. Since, the majority of visitors was German, all questions were asked in German. Five groups did not participate in the interview. Thus, there are only evaluable answers from 14 out of the 19 groups that were observed. 

The first question was if they would remember the gravesite of Haßleben. Twelve groups answered that they would remember it and only two admitted that they did not. When I followed up on the positive answers to check if they were correct, it turned out that three groups referred to another showcase on the first floor. Six of groups were not quit sure and needed a hint.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ bl !{\vrule width 1pt} nr }

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Answers to the first question of the pre-study's interview.}
	\label{tab:pre-study_question_1}  
\end{table}
All visitors of groups that did not remember the Haßleben-showcase were shown the correct showcase, so every interviewee knew what the actual topic of the questionnaire was.
\\
After the topic was clear, the groups were asked to name as many objects from the Haßleben-showcase as the could remember. In two cases the visitors could not remember anything. Two main categories emerged from the classified answers. First, \textit{jewelry} and second \textit{everyday objects} were identified. 
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ bl !{\vrule width 1pt} nr }

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Answers to the second question of the pre-study's interview.}
	\label{tab:pre-study_question_2}  
\end{table}
Noteworthy about the referred objects was the fact that many of them were described and hence had to be interpreted to be classified.
\\
The visitors imagination and expertise was tested with the third question. The groups were shown an image of the jewel box placed at the feet of the skeleton. The wood of the jewel box had deterred and only its metal fittings and content, a necklace and fibula, were left.  
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ bl !{\vrule width 1pt} nr }
		\rowstyle{\bfseries}

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Answers to the third question of the pre-study's interview.}
	\label{tab:pre-study_question_3}  
\end{table}
Half of the groups gave the correct answer and two more groups described the correct content, but did not mention the jewel box itself. Four more groups also tried to describe the content and were less precise. One group could not tell what was depicted on the image.
\\
When asked about the improvements one third of the visitors answered that everything was well end they would not change anything. The remaining recommendations were diverse.

	\caption{Answers to the fourth question of the pre-study's interview.}
	\label{tab:pre-study_question_4}  
\end{table}
To get further insight of the engagement of the visitors, they were asked if the have read the explanatory text, which is positioned to the left of the Haßleben-showcase. Eight groups admitted to not having read the description. One lone visitor did not read the text, but knew it from prior visits. The remaining five groups had read the text. Two of those skimmed it. 
\begin{table}[H]

	\caption{Answers to the fifth question of the pre-study's interview.}
	\label{tab:pre-study_question_5}  
\end{table}
At the end of the interview, visitors were asked on why and how often the visit museums. The reasons were sorted into two categories. The visitors go to see museums on \textit{special occasions} and out of certain \textit{interests}.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ bl !{\vrule width 1pt} nr }

The frequency at which the groups visit museums varies and the answers to this final question were vague. The two groups that gave precise descriptions also visit museums out of special interests.

In succession of the pre-study, the \ac{IMI}-system was implemented and its technical principles were tested under controlled conditions of a lab. The subsequent \textit{main study} at the Haßleben-showcase was due when the final installation was ready to work in its real world environment.
